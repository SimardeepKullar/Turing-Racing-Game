# Turing-Racing-Game
This is a drag strip race between two cars, a white and a yellow car. The program is written in a high-level, general purposing programming language called Turing.

Before running the game you must make sure you have the Turing Application downloaded. A turing.exe file has been attached which is needed to run the program.
The version attached is 4.1.1b so if you have a newer version the program may not run.

1. Download the Race Car Folder.
2. Download the turing.exe file.
3. Run the turing.exe file.
4. Once your inside the GUI, go to the top right and click "File". 
5. Search for the "Race Car" folder you previously downloaded and open it.
6. Once you open the folder, open the file called "Racing Cars.t".
      - Ensure that all the .mp3 .gif and .jpg files are in the same folder as the program "Racing Cars.t", as the program will not run otherwise.
7. Once opened, click the "Run" button in the top right of the GUI.
      - Now you should see a new window with a program displaying. The program is now running and this is the program interface.
8. To stop the program for any reason, click the "Stop" button located in the top right of the program interface window. 
9. To run the program again just follow the steps again.

Enjoy this fun little creative Drag Race Game!
