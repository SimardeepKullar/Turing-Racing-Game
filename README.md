# Turing-Racing-Game
This is a drag strip race between two cars, a white and a yellow car. The program is written in a high-level, general purposing programming language called Turing.

Before running the game you must make sure you have the Turing Application downloaded. A turing.exe file has been attached which is needed to run the program.
The version attached is 4.1.1b so if you have a newer version the program may not run.

1. Once you have downloaded the turing.exe file, all you need to do is open it.
2. Then once your inside the GUI, go to the top right of the GUI and click "File". Now search for your turing program from your computer and open it.
3. Once opened, all you need to do is click the "Run" button in the top right of the GUI, just under the "File" button.
4. Now you should see a new window with a program displaying. This is the program interface. If you need to stop the program for any reason, click the "Stop" button located
   in the top right of the second turing window with the program interface. 
5. To run the program again just follow the steps again.

Enjoy this fun little creative Drag Race Game!
